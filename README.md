## About Purpose Built Films

At Purpose Built, we believe in harnessing the power of storytelling to drive real-world change.

Founded by **Adam Laister**, a wildlife and conservation filmmaker with over 10 years of experience in high-end broadcast documentaries, Purpose Built grew from a desire to forge a new path in filmmaking.

Throughout his career, Adam has worked with leading broadcasters and platforms including **BBC**, **Netflix**, and **National Geographic**, creating visually striking films that captivate audiences around the world.

However, while television excels at entertainment, it often falls short in creating lasting impact. This realisation sparked a shift toward deeper, purpose-driven storytelling — stories that do not just inform or entertain, but inspire action.

With a background in **Environmental Science**, Adam combines scientific understanding with cinematic craft to tell the kinds of stories that do not always fit within traditional TV formats — stories rooted in urgency, honesty, and meaning.

Purpose Built began with a simple question:

> *What if the kind of films that move people in cinemas could also move them to take action?*

After years producing award-winning documentaries, Purpose Built has filmed alongside activists, frontline workers, and everyday heroes, always striving to go beyond surface-level storytelling.

Today, Purpose Built Films partners with **charities, ethical brands, and purpose-driven organisations** to help them connect with audiences in a meaningful way.  
No spin. No slogans. Just real stories, well told.
